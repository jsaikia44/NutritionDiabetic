Internet of Things based framework for non-invasive blood glucose monitoring
-
Hardware used:
1. Respberry Pie3
2. 5v LASER
3. Picamera V2.0
4. Power supply

Camera setting:
ISO sensitivity of 800, for brightness and contrast of 70.

Picamera captured the image of the fingertip which is placed on laser. The glucose level is predicted using the image captured.
A DNN based model is used to predict the glucose level. Based on the predicted glucose level, food is recommended.
